# puppet_vagrant_example
This is a basic example on how to provision with puppet using vagrant with a
simple puppet and shell script.
No module dependencies, no specs, no server-specs added.
The main idea is to simply understand how to link basics on these tools.

## usage

You need the following installed:

* ruby (use rvm)
* vagrant
* virtualbox

```bash
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/noelruiz/puppet_vagrant_example.git

# create vms
vagrant up

```
